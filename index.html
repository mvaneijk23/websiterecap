                <h4>What is the problem?</h4>
                <p class="Alinea">Plastic in the environment is a problem because it takes hundreds, if not thousands, of years to break down.<br>
                    This means that every piece of plastic that has ever been produced is still in the environment, either in a landfill or as litter in the oceans, forests, and other natural spaces.<br><br>
                    The presence of plastic in the environment poses a threat to both wildlife and human health. Plastic litter, such as bags and bottles, can be ingested by animals, leading to injury or death. 
                    Additionally, the chemicals used to produce plastic can leach into the soil and water, potentially contaminating the food chain and exposing humans to harmful substances.</p>

            <h5>What is the solution?</h4>
            <p class="Alinea">The plastic waste problem is one of the most pressing environmental issues of our time. Every year, millions of tons of plastic are produced, and much of it ends up in the oceans, harming marine life and ecosystems.<br>
                To solve this problem, we need to take a multi-faceted approach that involves reducing our overall consumption of plastic, properly disposing of the plastic we do use, and developing sustainable alternatives.<br><br>
                One of the most effective ways to reduce plastic waste is to simply use less plastic. This can be achieved through individual actions, such as using reusable water bottles, shopping bags, and food containers, as well as through collective action,
                such as supporting companies and policies that prioritize sustainability.</p>

        <h3>About Us</h3>
        <p class="aboutustext">We are Recap.<br>
            Recap is a plastic recycling company that is dedicated to reducing the amount of plastic waste in the environment. 
            The company was founded with the goal of providing a solution to the growing problem of plastic pollution.

            Recap collects plastic waste from various sources, including households, businesses, and industrial facilities. Once the plastic is collected, it is sorted and cleaned to remove any impurities. 
            The clean plastic is then shredded and melted down into small pellets, which can be used to make new plastic products.
            
            If every person did a little bit more then we would end up with a cleaner and healthier world.</p>
